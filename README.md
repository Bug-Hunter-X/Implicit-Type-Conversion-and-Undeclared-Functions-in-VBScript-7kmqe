This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in VBScript: the use of functions without explicit declaration or return type specification. Implicit type conversion can lead to unexpected behavior and runtime errors. The `bug.vbs` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides a corrected version with explicit function declarations and type handling.
